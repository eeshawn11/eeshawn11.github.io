Hey there! I am a Data Science Immersive graduate from General Assembly Singapore and new to the data community!
With over 7 years experience in Hospitality, this has been quite a major shift in my career trajectory, but
I've been fully enjoying my time picking up new skills like Python and SQL.

This site is a showcase of the projects that I have been working on in my free time, and comments
or suggestions for improvement are always welcomed!
