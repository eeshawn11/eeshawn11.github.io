Hey there, my first name is Ee Shawn, but just call me Shawn. I am a career switcher who
traded in 7 successful years in hospitality for a new adventure in coding. As a naturally
curious individual, I'm excited to tinker with projects, learn new skills and figure out
how to make things work.

When I'm not in front of the screen, I love hitting the yoga mat or walking in nature for
some fresh air. I'm a bit of a photography buff, so be sure to check out some of my shots
over on my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/ee_shawn/)!

This is a collection of various projects I have been working on in my free time, any
comments or suggestions for improvement are always welcomed.

If you're looking for a motivated and adaptable team player, look no further. Let's
connect and see how we can work together!
