As someone who's grown up playing games, I decided to challenge myself by creating a simple game in `PyGame`. During car rides while I was younger, I've often imagined a character running alongside our car and dodging obstacles. Although I'm not a graphics designer or game developer, I drew upon my knowledge of Python to bring my vision to life.

While the game concept was simple, it was interesting figuring out how to code various aspects of the game and gaining a better understanding of Object-Oriented Programming.

Skills Demonstrated:

- Designing and coding game mechanics with `PyGame`, such as collision detection
- `Object-Oriented Programming`in Python
- Program testing and debugging
