[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://wheresmybus.streamlit.app)

Instead of downloading multiple applications on my phone to perform various tasks, I usually find it more accessible to use a simple web app that performs a single function I need.

Hosted on Streamlit, WheresMyBus allows users to retrieve real-time bus arrival timings at a specified bus stop using the Land Transport Authority's [DataMall API](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en.html).

Skills Demonstrated:

- Real-time data handling through API
- Web app deployment in `streamlit`
