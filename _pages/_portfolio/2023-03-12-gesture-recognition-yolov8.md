Training and deploying a machine learning model that can recognise 12 basic hand seals from the Naruto anime using transfer learning with YOLOv8.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- Collecting and building my own dataset using `OpenCV`
- Image annotation with `LabelImg`
- Transfer learning using a pre-trained `YOLOv8` model
